# tutorlog
app for tracking student visits at a walk-in tutoring center, created with node/mongoDB/express

Right now it has CRUD for student visits, and i'm imminently planning imminently to implement login for tutors. After that I'll be doing some css cleanup and refactoring before adding more features
